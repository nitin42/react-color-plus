# react-color-tools

> A set of tools for working with colors

## Introduction

`react-color-tools` provides a set of tools for working with colors. These tools can be used to manipulate a color for example controlling the intensity or purity of color, extracting color palettes directly from an image, creating a gradient or choosing from variety of shades and tints.

## Motivation

`react-color-tools` is inspired from [`react-color`](https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color). I was using `react-color` for my projects and felt the need for more features like [image color extraction](https://react-color-extractor.surge.sh), generating shades and tints, creating gradient and advance color tools controlling the intensity and value of the color.

## Features

- Image color extraction

- Generate shades and tints

- Built-in color manipulation tools

- Create gradient by controlling the color stop positions

- API for color conversions

- Color harmonies

## Theory

So before we dive into the installaton setup, usage and example, let's learn a little bit about color, different color terms and color harmonies for choosing a color scheme.
